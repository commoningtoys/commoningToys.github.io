				<h1 style="background-color:black;">Thinking Toys (or Games) for Commoning</h1>
				<img src="img/diagram_overview.gif"> The sustainable use and the organisation of common resources is highly complex. With the focus on alternative, utopia-inspired
				urban neighbourhood initiatives in Switzerland this research project proposes experimental design and inquiry into media-based
				thinking tools which will help to better illustrate, demonstrate and negotiate the complexity of these sharing processes.
				<br>
				<br> Commons are sustainably and collectively managed resources, such as food, or communication infrastructures, such as
				Wi-Fi. Commoning, then, is the activity of sharing these resources. The aspiration formulated throughout numerous alternative,
				utopia-inspired projects that seeks to design infrastructural aspects of urban everyday life in an alternative and autonomous
				way, through commoning, raises several questions. Since, based on the high level of complexity that (occasionally) comes
				with the shared use of resources, for the individual community member it is often difficult to estimate his or her own
				action and consequences to the very last detail. Especially when it comes to unpredictable, complex adaptive processes,
				he or she can no longer completely grasp them intuitively nor follow them without the help of media-based thinking tools
				— such as computer-based models or scenarios — which make those processes not only visible but also comprehensible.
				<br>
				<br>For this reason, a mobile software application will be developed and tested in close collaboration with the members of
				three Swiss urban neighborhood projects: NeNa1 in Zurich, LeNa in Basel and Warmbächli in Bern. We will create playful
				simulations and design new thought-spaces for commoning. Our aim is to enable alternative and engaging ways for future
				social participation and transformation processes.
				<br>
				<br>The four-year project, which combines methods from humanities, social science and design inquires the following central
				question: How could an experimental and community-based approach to design and development of a digital game system stimulate
				reflection on the intuitively incomprehensible complexity of commoning, make it more understandable and negotiable through
				playing and gaming?

					Our team took part at transmediale 2018 face value with the workshop
					<a href="https://2018.transmediale.de/content/masquerade-for-commoning" target="_blank">"Masquerade for Commoning"</a>
					which we held on Sunday 4th of Feb. Since we then just started, we used this lovely occasion as a team building effort with
					guest colleague Felix Gerloff from the lab and external guest Kevin Rittberger. Kevin was involved earlier in 2015 with
					<a href="https://www.ixdm.ch/community-in-progress-syntegrity/" target="_blank">"Syntegrity".</a>
					<br>
					<br> Here a more detailed announcement of the workshop: Masquerade for Commoning wants to encourage you to tackle face value
					– Transmediale 2018’s thought-provoking trigger – via modulating the idea of the mask. Would a playful masquerade be
					helpful in order to discuss how we could respond to current practices of taking things at face value too fast and at
					the same time enable us to self-critically recognize moments when we also take our own ideals, values, and utopias at
					face value? What kind of biases and exploitative mechanisms are involved when we think, for example, about alternative
					models for creating value together? How would the masquerade unfold if we modulated face value with commoning?
					<br>
					<br> Commoning => a verb expressing the joint action of creating things together by drawing on a network of human and non-human
					relations created with the expectation of mutual care, aid, benefits and a shared understanding that some things could
					belong to all of us.
					<br>
					<br> Mask => an object or filter that can modify an identity in order to lie about it, take on a role, represent another,
					assume a collective identity, make identities equal, abstract an identity, reveal an identity, take possession of the
					mask's powers...
					<br>
					<br> Masquerade => a joint action of assuming and executing modified identities which usually involves the creation of new
					relationships between masked identities and produces a complex situation of co-dependencies.
					<br>
					<br> Masquerade for Commoning suggests to understand face value spectrally, not only dialectically and reconsider current
					models of valorization as producers of unwanted artifacts of our agricultural software that has been running for over
					five thousand years. We want to modulate and synthesize the mask, the act of masking, the masquerade, faces and values
					with cultural practices of commoning. The mask as a tangible artifact could enable different modes of understanding,
					enacting and modelling the dynamics that is at work in commoning. Performed by the workshop participants or in a real-life
					situation, the Masquerade for Commoning might shed new light on different constellations, social relations and dependencies
					between individual agents and their environments.
					<br>
					<br> In our times, we – you and us – are confronted with a difficult riddle: How can we imagine and build a radically different
					system of valorization and distribution while facing the constraints of current (neoliberal) geopolitical powers? Commoning,
					at face value, might be a simple and evident solution but it surely involves drama. More than a political theory or
					philosophy, commoning is an active, living process which involves a complex ecosystem of things, persons, infrastructures,
					resources, technologies, and architectures. Here, the mask comes into play almost seamlessly — etymologically related
					to ghosts and darkness and even mockery, masks have evolved into agents of impersonation, of taking on a role in a drama
					or performance. Masks are used to abstract certain aspects of an individual but also to conjure more-than-human superpowers.
					Masks are old artifacts humans used since immemorial times in rituals and on special occasions. A flat mask, moreover,
					as provided here, has a back and a front side. Thus it embodies the principle of binaries. Would that be a pathway to
					digitality?
					<br>
					<br> Join our session to collaboratively and playfully discuss, sketch, design masks and model constellations of commoning.
					The blank mask accompanying this print (PDF output) is our invitation to the first Masquerade for Commoning at the last
					day of Transmediale 2018 (Feb 4th (Sunday), 14:00–17:00, K2, HKW).
