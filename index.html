              The sustainable use and the organisation of common resources is highly complex. With the focus
              on
              alternative,
              utopia-inspired
              urban neighbourhood initiatives in Switzerland this research project proposes experimental
              design
              and inquiry into
              media-based
              thinking tools which will help to better illustrate, demonstrate and negotiate the complexity of
              these sharing
              processes.
              <br>
              <br> Commons are sustainably and collectively managed resources, such as food, or communication
              infrastructures,
              such
              as Wi-Fi. Commoning, then, is the activity of sharing these resources. The aspiration formulated
              throughout
              numerous
              alternative, utopia-inspired projects that seeks to design infrastructural aspects of urban
              everyday
              life in an
              alternative
              and autonomous way, through commoning, raises several questions. Since, based on the high level
              of
              complexity that
              (occasionally)
              comes with the shared use of resources, for the individual community member it is often
              difficult to
              estimate his
              or
              her own action and consequences to the very last detail. Especially when it comes to
              unpredictable,
              complex
              adaptive
              processes, he or she can no longer completely grasp them intuitively nor follow them without the
              help of
              media-based
              thinking tools ‚Äî such as computer-based models or scenarios ‚Äî which make those processes not
              only
              visible but also
              comprehensible.
              <br>
              <br>For this reason, a mobile software application will be developed and tested in close
              collaboration with the
              members
              of three Swiss urban neighborhood projects: NeNa1 in Zurich, LeNa in Basel and Warmb√§chli in
              Bern.
              We will create
              playful
              simulations and design new thought-spaces for commoning. Our aim is to enable alternative and
              engaging ways for
              future
              social participation and transformation processes.
              <br>
              <br>The four-year project, which combines methods from humanities, social science and design
              inquires the following
              central
              question: How could an experimental and community-based approach to design and development of a
              digital game system
              stimulate
              reflection on the intuitively incomprehensible complexity of commoning, make it more
              understandable
              and negotiable
              through
              playing and gaming?
