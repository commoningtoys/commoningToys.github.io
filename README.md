Note on the website
1. this is a commonist website. It means that everyone can contribute to it. The source will open. The contribution will e revised to avoid the damaging contribution.
2. each contributor has to define it's own contribution style by adding it to the css.
For example in the stylesheet.css
```
myName{
    /*
    various
    css
    style
    implementations
    */
}
```
in the HTML
```
<div class="(seriuos blog, team, mood board or project)">
    <myName>
        My very own wonderful and meaningful contribution
    </myName>
</div>
```
