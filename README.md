Note on the [website](https://commoningtoys.github.io/commoningWebsite/)
1. this is a commonist website. It means that everyone can contribute to it. The source will open. The contribution will e revised to avoid the damaging contribution.
2. each contributor has to define it's own contribution style by adding it to the css.
For example in the stylesheet.css
```
myName{
    /*
    various
    css
    style
    implementations
    (please use comic sans!)
    */
}
```
in the HTML
```
<div class="(seriuos blog, team, mood board or project)">
    <myName>
        My very own wonderful and meaningful contribution
    </myName>
</div>
```

##Comprehensive CSS reference can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp) and for HTML can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) 
This ensure our very own fight against corporativst design.
1. This approach is a teaching approach, to add a contribution you need to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Hopefully creative minds will use it to empower they very own practice, creating interesting new visuals.
2. This approach aims to criticize the standardized beauty of the WP, CargoCollective, Format etc. way of designing web pages.
